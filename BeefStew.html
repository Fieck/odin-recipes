        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This traditional Beef Stew is the best Slow Cooker recipe for Fall and Winter. It’s loaded with tender bites
            of
            juicy beef, golden potatoes, carrots, peas, red wine, onions, garlic, and a hearty beef broth. Serve it with
            warm biscuits, cornbread, or even over mashed potatoes.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li> ½ teaspoon celery salt</li>
            <li> 1/4 cup flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut meat into 1-inch cubes, discard any large pieces of fat. Fat marbleized into the meat is fine!</li>
            <li>Season beef with pepper, garlic salt, and celery salt. Toss to coat. Sprinkle flour over the meat and
                toss
                again. Sear the meat in batches for 45 seconds per side and transfer to the Slow Cooker. </li>
            <li>Melt 1 Tablespoon of butter and soften the onions and garlic, scraping up any meat remnants up from the
                pot.
                Add a splash of wine to help loosen if necessary. Transfer to the Slow Cooker.
